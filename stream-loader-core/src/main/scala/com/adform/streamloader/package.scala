/**
  * The entry point of the stream loader library is the [[StreamLoader]] class, which requires a [[KafkaSource]] and a [[Sink]]. Once started
  * it will subscribe to the provided topics and will start polling and sinking records.
  * The sink has to be able to persist records and to look up committed offsets (technically this is optional, but without it there would
  * be no way to provide any delivery guarantees). A large class of sinks are batch based, implemented as $RecordBatchingSink.
  * This sink accumulate batches of records using some $RecordBatcher and once ready, stores them to some underlying $RecordBatchStorage.
  * A common type of batch is file based, i.e. a batcher might write records to a temporary file and once the file is full
  * the sink commits the file to some underlying storage, such as a database or a distributed file system like HDFS.
  *
  * A sketch of the class hierarchy illustrating the main classes and interfaces can be seen below.

  * For concrete storage implementations see the [[clickhouse]], [[hadoop]], [[s3]] and [[vertica]] packages.
  * They also contain more file builder implementations than just the $CsvFileBuilder included in the core library.
