/**
  * Base trait that describes Kafka consumer record sinking to some underlying storage.
  * Implementers need to define committed position lookup for a list of assigned partitions which are then
  * used to rewind the streams. They are also responsible for implementing offset committing.
  *
  * Implementers can chose to use Kafka itself for offset storage by using the provided [[KafkaContext]],
  * they can also store/retrieve offsets to/from the storage itself. The delivery guarantees of a sink depend
  * on the offset management, e.g. storing offsets atomically with data guarantees exactly-once storage, whereas
  * using only Kafka for offset storage will usually result in either at-least-once of at-most-once semantics.
